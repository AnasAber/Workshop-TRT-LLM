Welcome to *From model weights to API endpoint with TensorRT-LLM* presented at The AI Engineer World's Fair!

We're your hosts, Pankaj Gupta and Philip Kiely from [Baseten](https://www.baseten.co), and we're thrilled to have you here today.

This workshop has three live coding components, which correspond to numbered folders:

1. Building a TensorRT engine manually with TensorRT-LLM
2. Building an engine automatically on deployment with Truss
3. Benchmarking deployed models

Specific instructions for each component are in the respective folders' READMEs.

Let's get some TPS!
